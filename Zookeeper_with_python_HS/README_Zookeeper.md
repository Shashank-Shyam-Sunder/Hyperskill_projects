# Zookeeper

## Overview
Zookeeper is a simple interactive program that simulates a virtual zoo. It displays ASCII art representations of various animals based on user input. This project demonstrates basic Python concepts like strings, lists, loops, and conditional statements.

## Features
- ASCII art representations of various animals (camel, lion, deer, goose, bat, rabbit)
- Interactive habitat selection through user input
- Continuous operation until the user decides to exit
- Simple and engaging user interface

## How It Works
1. The program stores ASCII art representations of different animals in a list
2. It prompts the user to enter the number of the habitat they want to view
3. Based on the user's input, it displays the corresponding animal's ASCII art
4. The program continues to prompt for input until the user types "exit"
5. When the user types "exit", the program displays a farewell message and terminates

## Animals Included
- Camel
- Lion
- Deer
- Goose
- Bat
- Rabbit

## Usage Example
```
Please enter the number of the habitat you would like to view: 1

## Skills Demonstrated
- Working with multi-line strings (raw strings with r""")
- Storing and accessing data in lists
- User input handling
- Conditional statements (if-else)
- Loop control with a while loop and break statement
- String comparison
- Type conversion (string to integer)
- ASCII art creation and display

## Requirements
- Python 3.6 or higher

You can install the required dependencies using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements_zookeeper.txt
```

## Educational Value
This project is an excellent introduction to Python programming, demonstrating:
- Basic syntax and data structures
- Control flow
- User interaction
- String manipulation
- Program organization

It provides an engaging way for beginners to practice these concepts while creating something visual and interactive.
