**Features:**
- Input number of friends and their names
- Split bill equally among all friends
- "Who is lucky?" feature to exempt one person from payment
- Recalculate shares when a lucky person is selected

### File Manager
A command-line file system navigator that allows users to explore directories and files.

**Features:**
- Navigate directories with cd commands
- View current directory with pwd
- List directory contents with ls
- View file sizes in different formats (bytes, KB, MB, GB)
- Error handling for invalid commands and paths

### HTTP Requests
Examples of using Python's requests library for HTTP operations and API interactions.

**Features:**
- Make GET requests to various websites and APIs
- Handle response status codes and content
- Parse JSON responses
- Implement caching for API requests
- Weather data API integration with TTL caching

### Loan Calculator
A loan calculator that computes different loan parameters based on user input.

- Interest rate calculations
- Command-line argument parsing
- Overpayment calculation

### Regular Expressions
A collection of examples and exercises demonstrating the use of regular expressions in Python.

**Features:**
- Pattern matching with re.match(), re.search(), re.findall()
- Text substitution with re.sub()
- String splitting with re.split()
- Various regex patterns and concepts
- Regex flags for case-insensitive and multi-line matching

### Simple Calculator
A basic calculator that performs arithmetic operations on two numbers.

**Features:**
- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
- Modulus, power, and integer division operations
- Error handling for division by zero

### Simple Chatbot
An interactive chatbot that engages users in conversation and demonstrates various programming concepts.

**Features:**
- Introduction and name recognition
- Age guessing using mathematical tricks
- Counting demonstration
- Programming knowledge quiz
- Structured conversation flow

### Zookeeper
A virtual zoo simulation that displays ASCII art representations of animals based on user input.

**Features:**
